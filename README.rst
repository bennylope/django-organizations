Separate individual user identity from accounts and subscriptions. Django
Organizations adds user-managed, multi-user groups to your Django project. Use
Django Organizations whether your site needs organizations that function like
social groups or multi-user account objects to provide account and subscription
functionality beyond the individual user.

* Works with your existing user model, whether
  `django.contrib.auth` or a custom model. No additional user
  or authentication functionality required.
* Users can be belong to and own more than one organization (account, group)
* Invitation and registration functionality works out of the box for many
  situations and can be extended as need to fit specific requirements.
* Start with the base models or use your own for greater customization.

Documentation is on `Read the Docs
<http://django-organizations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_

Installing
==========

First add the application to your Python path. The easiest way is to use
`pip`::

    pip install django-organizations

You should install by downloading the source and running::

    $ python setup.py install

.. note::
    If you are using Django<=1.4.10, or >=1.5.0,<1.5.5, you
    will need to install an up-to-date version of the `six` package. Previous
    Django versions included an older version of `six` with which Django
    Organizations is incompatible.

.. note::

    If you are using South you must use 1.0. Django Organizations is
    incompatible with earlier versions of South, as this project uses the
    `south_migrations` folder for schema migrations in order to maintain Django
    1.7 compatability.

Configuring
-----------

Make sure you have `django.contrib.auth` installed, and add the `organizations`
application to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'organizations',
    )

Then ensure that your project URL conf is updated. You should hook in the
main application URL conf as well as your chosen invitation backend URLs::

    from organizations.backends import invitation_backend

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^accounts/', include('organizations.urls')),
        url(r'^invitations/', include(invitation_backend().get_urls())),
    )

You can specify a different invitation backend in your project settings, and
the `invitation_backend` function will provide the URLs defined by that
backend::

    ORGS_INVITATION_BACKEND = 'myapp.backends.MyInvitationBackend'

There is also a lightly tested way to use your own user model, rather than the
default `auth.User` model. Set the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting to the dotted
model name of your custom user model, following the procedure in Django 1.5::

    AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'myuserapp.MyUser'


Usage Overview
==============

For most use cases it should be sufficient to include the app views directly
using the default URL conf file. You can customize their functionality or
access controls by extending the base views.

There are three models:

* **Organization** The group object. This is what you would associate your own
  app's functionality with, e.g. subscriptions, repositories, projects, etc.
* **OrganizationUser** A custom `through` model for the ManyToMany relationship
  between the `Organization` model and the `User` model. It stores additional
  information about the user specific to the organization and provides a
  convenient link for organization ownership.
* **OrganizationOwner** The user with rights over the life and death of the
  organization. This is a one to one relationship with the `OrganizationUser`
  model. This allows `User` objects to own multiple organizations and makes it
  easy to enforce ownership from within the organization's membership.

The underlying organizations API is simple::

    >>> chris = User.objects.get(username="chris")
    >>> soundgarden = create_organization(chris, "Soundgarden", org_user_defaults={'is_admin': True})
    >>> soundgarden.is_member(chris)
    True
    >>> soundgarden.is_admin(chris)
    True
    >>> soundgarden.owner.organization_user
    <OrganizationUser: Chris Cornell>
    >>> soundgarden.owner.organization_user.user
    >>> <User: chris>
    >>> audioslave = create_organization(chris, "Audioslave")
    >>> tom = User.objects.get(username="tom")
    >>> audioslave.add_user(tom, is_admin=True)
    <OrganizationUser: Tom Morello>

Custom models
-------------

Django-organizations can act as a base library (not installed in your project)
and used to create unique organization model sets using custom tables. See the
`Cooking with Django Organizations
<http://django-organizations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#advanced-customization>`_
section in the documentation for advice on proceeding.

Development & Contributing
==========================

Development is on-going. To-do items have been moved to the wiki for the time
being.

The basic functionality should not need much extending. Current dev priorities
for me and contributors should include:

* Improving the tests and test coverage (ideally moving them back out of the
  main module and executable using the setup.py file)
* Improving the backends and backends concept so that additional invitation and
  registration backends can be used
* Documentation
* Ensuring all application text is translatable
* Python 3 readiness

Please use the project's issues tracker to report bugs, doc updates, or other
requests/suggestions.

Targets & testing
-----------------

The codebase is targeted at tested against:

* Django 1.4.x against Python 2.6 and Python 2.7
* Django 1.5.x against Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.3
* Django 1.6.x against Python 2.7 and Python 3.3

To run the tests against all target environments, install `tox
<https://testrun.org/tox/latest/>`_ and then execute the command:

    tox

Submitting
----------

These submission guidelines will make it more likely your submissions will be
reviewed and make it into the project:

* Ensure they match the project goals and are sufficiently generalized
* Please try to follow `Django coding style
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/>`_.
  The code base style isn't all up to par, but I'd like it to move in that
  direction
* Also please try to include `good commit log messages
  <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.
* Pull requests should include an amount of code and commits that are
  reasonable to review, are **logically grouped**, and based off clean feature
  branches.

Code contributions are expected to pass in all target environments, and
pull requests should be made from branches with passing builds on `Travis
CI <https://travis-ci.org/bennylope/django-organizations>`_.

Project goals
-------------

django-organizations should be backend agnostic:

1. Authentication agnostic
2. Registration agnostic
3. Invitation agnostic
4. User messaging agnostic

Etc.
